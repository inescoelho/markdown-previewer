# Markdown Previewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), wired up for [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter).

The [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) is used to interprete Markdown language.

[Bootstrap 4](https://reactstrap.github.io/) is used to facilitate the page display.
